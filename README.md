*LifeLine Hub* is a web-based health assistance platform designed to provide quick access to life-saving information, emergency tools, and interactive learning resources. The primary goal of the project is to create an easily accessible, user-friendly system that empowers individuals to respond effectively during medical emergencies and to enhance their overall health awareness. The platform integrates multiple features, including a *First Aid Guide* with step-by-step instructions and educational videos, an *interactive health quiz* to test and improve usersâ€™ medical knowledge, and an *Emergency Assistance module* that allows users to instantly notify emergency contacts and locate nearby hospitals using geolocation services. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness across devices and a clean, intuitive interface. LifeLine Hub serves as a bridge between professional healthcare systems and the general public by offering reliable, quick, and accessible health-related guidance. This project demonstrates the potential of technology to improve community health preparedness, promote first-aid literacy, and provide essential support in critical situations.
